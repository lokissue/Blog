I studied Computer Science at University of Melbourne. During my study career, I learnt how the web works, explored the web programming. Gradually I found my passion on frontend developing and love to build things. 

The raod to become a frontend developer is never straight, I decided to start my programming blog. Sharing pushes me to learn more about modern frontend developing techniques.


You can see more of my projects on my [Github](https://github.com/lokissue).
